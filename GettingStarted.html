<h1>Getting Started with Pyjs</h1>
<p>Programming with pyjamas needs a little bit of rethinking about the way that you do Web application development.  Primarily, you need to forget virtually everything you've ever learned and come to expect Web development to be.  The reason for this is very simple: Pyjs is pure javascript.  Although written in python, not javascript, it is <strong>essential</strong> to bear in mind that virtually 100% of your web application will be javascript - not HTML.  The programming style you may be accustomed to for HTML programming involves placing as much HTML into one page as you can stand, and making the minimum number of exceptions and allowances for dynamic content that you can manage, without making the HTML page &quot;too complicated&quot; to be readable.</p>
<p>Pyjamas makes it possible for you to break pages down into concepts. classes.  widgets.  maybe some CSS styling is added, almost as an afterthought, on top of the &quot;real&quot; functionality.  In other words, Pyjamas is actually more like Desktop application development than it is Web development.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the best possible starting point has to be the <a class="reference external" href="examples">examples</a>, most of which were ported from Google Web Toolkit.  They will make it really clear just how &quot;not&quot; Web that pyjamas - and incidentally GWT - really are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>The simplest example is of course the traditional <a class="reference external" href="examples/helloworld/output/Hello.html">Hello World</a> or, in this case, Hello AJAX.  If you've downloaded pyjamas, you will be able to browse, with your browser, to the examples directory and see this in action for yourself.  Type &quot;<a class="reference external" href="file://home/yourusername/pyjamas/examples">file://home/yourusername/pyjamas/examples</a>&quot; into your URL bar - or wherever you have unpacked pyjamas to and continue to browse to the helloworld output directory.</p>
<p>Once you have played with the example, online, try it on your local machine.  Remember to run the &quot;build.sh&quot; script (if you have linux or MacOS, or execute python.exe ../../build/build.py Hello.py if you have windows).  Then, take a look at the source code that generated it, which is shown here:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from pyjamas import Window
from pyjamas.ui import RootPanel, Button

def greet(sender):
  Window.alert(&quot;Hello, AJAX!&quot;)

b = Button(&quot;Click me&quot;, greet)
RootPanel().add(b)
</pre>
<p>The most important thing to note is that everything gets added to <em>RootPanel</em>.  RootPanel() gives you access to the Browser's DOM model (starting of course at <em>body</em>).  To illustrate, try adding this, and see what happens:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
RootPanel().add(HTML(&quot;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&quot;))
</pre>
<p>You <em>should</em> get nothing - and if you look in your Javascript console for an error message, you should find an error indicating that &quot;HTML&quot; does not exist.  This is correct - because you needed to add this to the top of the module, along with the other imports:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from pyjamas.ui import HTML
</pre>
<p>Now if you re-run build.sh, you should see both a button and next to it the words &quot;Hello <strong>World</strong>&quot;.  Congratulations, you've just successfully developed your first pyjamas application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Now you've started on a simple example, and have seen some of the more involved ones, you might want to see a little bit more about what can actually be achieved, so that you can start making your own application.  Whilst the <a class="reference external" href="examples/kitchensink/output/KitchenSink.html">kitchen sink</a> example covers every single widget in existence, you may find that browsing the source code of this example to be rather inconvenient.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="showcase/Showcase.html">showcase</a>, however, contains documentation on each of the main classes in the <tt class="docutils literal">ui</tt> module. It describes how to use each of the classes, what they are for, and, crucially, it includes a working example and the source code for that example.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pyjamas's Documentation is auto-generated from the source code, and there are two locations where this is available. The first is simply a python gendoc-generated version, <a class="reference external" href="api">here</a>.  A second version, which uses a modified version of python pydoc.py, will be available later, but if you want to explore it yourself, use pyjamas-desktop, cd into the pyjamas directory, and run &quot;../pydoc.py -w ./&quot; to have the code auto-generated into a docs/ directory.  Then, on each of the modules auto-generated, run build.py on each of them.</p>
<p>So, there is quite a lot for you to be able to get started on your application.  A recommended approach is, like as with any programming, to find a working example that is close to what you want, and cut and paste it into your own code, step-by-step.  Both the showcase and the examples make that much easier to do.</p>

<div class="section" id="create-your-own-widget-tutorial">
<h1>Create your own Widget Tutorial</h1>
<p>All of the above covers how to use widgets: it doesn't explain how to write one - how to make your own widget.  Fortunately, there's a <a class="reference external" href="ControlsTutorial.html">tutorial</a> on how to do exactly that.  It was inspired by the pygtk2 create-a-widget tutorial, and you may find it interesting to compare just how easy it is to create a widget in pyjamas with how complex it is in pygtk.</p>
